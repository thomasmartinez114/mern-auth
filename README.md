Back-End Packages:

- axios: promise based HTTP client for making requests to our backend
- classnames: used for conditional classes in our JSX
- jwt-decode: used to decode our jwt so we can get user data from it
- react-redux: allows us to use Redux with React
- react-router-dom: used for routing purposes
- redux: used to manage state between components (can be used with React or any other view library)
- redux-thunk: middleware for Redux that allows us to directly access the dispatch method to make asynchronous calls from our actions
